/**
 * Validate that the committed bundle-size manifest is up to date.
 *
 * A PR that changes runtime code (or scenes) such that per-scene bundle sizes
 * move MUST also commit the regenerated `lab/public/bundle/manifest.json`.
 * GUIDANCE.md makes this mandatory so reviewers can see size deltas in the diff
 * and the tracked baseline stays in sync with the code.
 *
 * This script is meant to run in CI AFTER `pnpm build:bundle-scenes`, which
 * overwrites the working-tree manifest with freshly measured sizes. It compares
 * that freshly built manifest against the version committed at `git HEAD`. Sizes
 * are rounded to whole KB before comparison (matching the PR delta comment), so
 * sub-KB gzip jitter does not cause spurious failures.
 *
 * It also compares each scene's `runtimeChunks` set. Chunk filenames carry a
 * content hash, so they change whenever a PR alters code that actually lands in
 * that scene's bundle (its own scene code or a shared module it imports). This
 * catches content-only changes that leave the rounded KB sizes unchanged.
 *
 * Exit code 1 (with a helpful message) when the committed manifest is stale.
 *
 * Usage: npx tsx scripts/validate-bundle-manifest.ts
